        <h2 style="color: navy;"><a name="e">EARLY LIFE</a></h2>
            <p id="p1">The name Jayalalithaa was adopted at the age of one for the purpose of using the name in school and colleges.
                It was derived from the names of two houses where she resided in Mysore. 
                One was <b>"Jaya Vilas"</b> and the other <b>"Lalitha Vilas"</b>. 
                Her paternal grandfather, Narasimhan Rengachary, was in the service of the Mysore kingdom as a surgeon, and served as the court physician to Maharaja Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV of Mysore.
                Her maternal grandfather, Rangasamy Iyengar, moved to Mysore from Srirangam to work with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.
                He had one son and three daughters <b>Ambujavalli, Vedavalli and Padmavalli</b>. 
                Vedavalli was married to Jayaram son of Narasimhan Rengachary. 
                The couple <b>Jayaram-Vedvalli</b> had two children: <b>a son Jayakumar</b> and <b>a daughter, Jayalalitha</b>.
               Her mother, her relatives and later co-stars and friends referred to her as <b>Ammu</b>.</p>
        <h2 style="color: navy;"><a name="f">FILM CAREER</a></h2>
         <p id="p2">
            In Madras (now Chennai), Jayalalithaa was trained in <b>Carnatic music</b>, western classical piano and various forms of classical dance, including <b>Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Mohiniyattam, Manipuri, Kathak</b>.
            She learnt Bharatnatyam and dance forms under K.J.Sarasa.
            She had also learnt Kuchipudi under Padma Bhushan Guru Dr. Vempati Chinna Satyam.
            She became an accomplished dancer and gave her debut dance performance at the Rasika Ranjani Sabha in Mylapore in May 1960.
            The Chief Guest at the Arangetram was <b>Shivaji Ganesan</b>, who expressed wish that Jayalalithaa becomes a film star in future.
